- 👋 Hi, I’m @rdizor
- 👀 I’m interested in using machine learning to actuate an exoskeleton.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on my PhD in Intelligent Sys and Robotics at the University of West Florida.
- 💞️ I’m looking to further my understanding of both supervised and unsupervised ML.
- 📫 How to reach me here is straight forward, but I am proverbally swamped while slowly making progress on my dissertation.
